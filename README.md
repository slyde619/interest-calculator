# Compound Interest Calculator

A simple compound interest calculator built using vanilla JavaScript, leveraging classes and the DOM for dynamic interaction.

## Features
- Calculates compound interest based on user input
- Updates results dynamically in the UI
- Built with pure JavaScript (no frameworks)

## How It Works
- Uses a JavaScript class to handle compound interest calculations.
- Listens for user input via the DOM and updates the UI dynamically.
- Formula used:  
  ```
  A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)
  ```
  Where:
  - `A` = final amount
  - `P` = principal amount
  - `r` = annual interest rate (decimal)
  - `n` = number of times interest applied per time period
  - `t` = number of years

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6 Classes, DOM Manipulation)
